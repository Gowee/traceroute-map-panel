[IPAPI.co](https://ipapi.co) provides IP GeoLocation API with 1k lookups [free quota](https://ipapi.co/pricing/) per day, requiring no sign-up.

This API has stricter limitation on burst requests. In case rate-limit is triggered, try to disable parallelization or fasten the rate-limiting options (e.g. `3` and `2`, respectively).

Even though it is fairly accurate, lat/long for some IP ranges are only available for paid plans. As a result, some hops might disappear on the map.
